# Why create a custom persitence controller

Using auto generated code from coreData is easy but it doesn't give a lot of space to customize its code and edit functions, that why we decided to create
our personal persistence controller.

# Persistence controller creation

In order to do it create a new file and create a struct like this: 

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Alfuroot/83ae3dc1f10930dddbbb974d6840d1f8.js"></script>

Then you will want to add a save funcion in order to keep changes on your data

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Alfuroot/c3caaceadefc324d46545e463b56e8c0.js"></script>

```swift
var mammt: String
```
